# Cpp_Sorting_Visualization

June 2018
Program uses three different sorting algorithms (merge, quick,
and selection) to sort the same set of randomized (unique) data
values sequentially, and visually represents the process using 
colored bars and a green progress line.
   Specs for each algorithm are also recorded, including time
taken to sort the entirety of the data, number of comparisons
the computer had to make, as well as number of moves it made.
