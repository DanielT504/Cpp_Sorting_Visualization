I do not own the AP classes, they are publically available and only included for the program's ease of use

Permission to Post Statement:
"Inclusion of the C++ classes defined for use in the Advanced Placement Program Computer Science courses does not constitute endorsement of the other material at this website by the College Board, Educational Testing Service, or the AP Computer Science Development Committee.  The versions of the C++ classes defined for use in the AP Computer Science courses included at this website were accurate as of August 1998.  Revisions to the classes may have been made since that time."
Note:  While the above statement is a requirement for posting the AP Classes, no further revisions were made after 1998 and the AP language changed to Java.
